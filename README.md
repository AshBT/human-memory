# Human Memory

Welcome!  This repository contains course materials for the Dartmouth course [Human Memory (PSYC 51.09)](https://pbs.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/courses-and-syllabi/topics-courses-2020-2021).  The syllabus may be found [[here](https://github.com/ContextLab/human-memory/blob/main/admin/PSYC_51_syllabus.pdf)].  Feel free to follow along with the course materials (whether you are officially enrolled in the course or just visiting!), submit comments and suggestions, etc.

# Orientation
**Start here!**  The materials for each module below are organized sequentially.  Work your way from section to section (and from top to bottom within each section).  The recorded lectures (in **bold**) typically cover preceding material (after the previous lecture, within the same module). Take notes on questions, comments, concerns, etc. so that you can bring them up for discussion during our synchronous class meetings.

Each of the sections below (except the next one) covers a specific aspect of human learning and memory.  Most of the sections (all but the last) correspond to specific chapters in our [course textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Human-Memory-Michael-Kahana/dp/0199387648/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=9780195333244&linkCode=qs&qid=1616513423&s=books&sr=1-1).  You should read the given chapter(s) *prior* to our course meeting on that topic.

# Assignments

All assignments should be submitted via the [course Canvas page](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/45671) unless otherwise specified.  Point values are indicated in parentheses.  Note that all problem sets are graded as credit (1 point) or no credit (0 points).  To recieve credit for a problem set you must turn in the complete problem set by the due date.  (There is no credit for late assignments and/or partially completed assignments.)

Exams will be taken via [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/); the associated links will become active when each exam goes live.  Exams are open-book and must be completed within 24 hours their respective start times.  **Collaboration and cooperation on problem sets is encouraged, but exams must be completed individually.**

- [Problem set 1]() (1 point)
- [Problem set 2]() (1 point)
- [Problem set 3]() (1 point)
- [Problem set 4]() (1 point)
- [Midterm exam]() (20 points; covers content through Chapter 4, inclusive)
- [Problem set 5]() (1 point)
- [Problem set 6]() (1 point)
- [Problem set 7]() (1 point)
- [Final exam]() (25 points; covers *all* course content)
